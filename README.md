PolSV
=====

PolSV (Pol Single View) is a single view hybrid application that allows users to send questions to friends and receive graphical feedback in a timely manner (if they so choose).

---Looking Forward---

-Make the chart view reactive (possibly through the use of meteor.js)

-Eliminate the use of PushApps for push notifications

-Modify the aesthetics
